1.0.0
~~~~~

- Fixed the bug that caused icecast to only accept
  encoder connections on every other connect.

- Major overhaul of shout with bugfixes.

0.9.0
~~~~~

- Icecast should now be relatively feature
  complete for version 1.0.  We may add a few
  things, but for the most part, we want to fix
  outstanding bugs in this version before we
  release 1.0.  It has also been tested on all the
  platforms listed in the TESTED file.

- Added javacast to the distribution.  Javacast is
  not as feature complete as icecast, but provides
  most basic features now.

- Added server redirection functionality.  Icecast
  can now use another *cast server as a source of
  the stream.  This can be configured at the
  command line or in the icecast.h file.

- Fixed ctrl-c and signal handling

- Added remote administration features.  You can
  now telnet into another port (default 8002),
  give a remote admin password, and then use the
  console to get information about the server or
  send it certain commands.  More functionality
  will be introduced in version 1.1 of icecast.

- Misc bugfixes

0.8.2
~~~~~

- Added perl script to icedir to clean out the old
  servers that didn't remove themselves.

- Added index.phtml to icedir to give an example
  of how to interface with the directory engine

- Added a control-c handler to icecast to let it
  shutdown a bit more gracefully although this
  doesn't work quite right while waiting for an 
  encoder

- A few minor code cleanups in icecast

- Bugfix to iceplay to prevent it from hogging the
  processor by Steve Shreeve

- Bugfix to use IO::Socket in iceplay instead of the
  normal Socket interface (this fixes the weird 
  glitches, although there is still an annoying
  pause every minute on the dot :) by Edward Rudd
  <eddie@omegaware.com>

- Merged in the shout project with iceplay.  iceplay
  is not longer the default encoder, we recommend
  using shout, as it is much more robust, and
  doesn't have any of the known iceplay bugs.  iceplay
  will be included for reference only, and will 
  probably no longer be developed (although patches
  may still be applied)

0.8.1
~~~~~

- Fixed a huge bug with zombie processes.  We
  weren't catching the SIGCHLD signals and
  cleaning up after the children.  

- A smaller bug was found by Wolfram Ricter, which
  apparently affected AIX platforms.

- Updated iceplay documentation so that it mentioned
  that it needed Time::HiRes to compile.
