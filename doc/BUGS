Bugs listing for icecast 1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Although not a bug, it is often mistaken for a bug: when using the
remote admin console, the data that you can see (not including the log) is
frozen as it was when you connected to the remote admin port.  This means
that if there were 3 listeners when you connected as a remote admin, no
matter what happens during that remote admin session, you'll still see 3
listeners.  The log command will work however.
